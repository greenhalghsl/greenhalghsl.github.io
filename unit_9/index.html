<h1>Design Critique:</h1>
<br>
<h2>Sagmeister.</h2>
<br>
<p>I am aware of this designer in particular his designs for record covers and graphic design books, particularly the David Byrne book Feelings which is really big yellow and very rubbery!</p>
<br>
<p>The site works as a portfolio of sorts and as an archive, there is a sense of depth and lots of material to explore.</p>
<br>
<p>The home page with the fisheye lens image of the studio is an interesting image to start with and then navigation is a little hidden at the top which is a good place for it but the plus sign doesn&#8217;t immediately jump out at you. When the nav bar does expand it&#8217;s very central on the page though.</p>
<br>
<p>Its interesting that they advertise a new site coming soon.</p>
<br>
<p>The answers section has an interview with the designers which means there&#8217;s a lot of text but it looks very clean almost neutral in the choice of typeface which does not distract you from the content.  It&#8217;s also is nicely responsive when you zoom in or view on mobile devices.</p>
<br>
<p>The emphasis is on the colour of the images, the rest is black, white grey with some whitespace, I think I prefer more.</p> 
<br>


<h2>Mimarch.</h2>

<p>Looks a little dated. A bit fancier than web 1.0 stuff but not much. Some clashing colour choices. Too much content laid out on home page. I quite like the quotations that are animated, but their affect is lost, hidden away between more confusing content.</p>
<br>
<p>Unordered lists with bullet points not good.  Actually looks slightly better when zoomed in or on mobile.  The elements are stacked onto of each other are so the flow works better. Some random colour choices. Collapsed menu hamburger check.</p>
<br>
<p>Typeface simple but Logo lost and not effective amidst too much content. Capitalisation runs amok.</p>
<br>

<h2>Self.</h2>
<br>
<p>Bleep.com and autechre.ws etc were the starting points for my project. I like the music and the design and how the intersection of different visual experiences get represented in the 2d space of a screen.  Simplicity and functionality are the benchmarks for good design for me. I don&#8217;t think fancy animations or trick-sy clever-clever stuff stays interesting for long.  Web design moves so fast that the latest design strategies become outdated very quickly. There is also the sense that there are so many possibilities and choice a designer can make that one is almost paralysed by this.  The careful layout of images and information should for the main framework of a successful website where the content is king as they say.</p>
<br>
<p>I am still not satisfied with my page, the design choices were really the result of getting the content and structure to line up in a balanced way. Choosing fonts is a full time task for me. My video choices are now unavailable in my youtube region so I&#8217;ll have to change that.</p>
<br>
<p>Coding the html / css to function was my favourite bit although frustrating at times, mostly problems caused by typos.</p>
<br>
<p>Using floats proved harder than I thought it would and has still to be addressed on some of my sub pages.</p>
<br>
<p>Decided to get rid of fancy scrolling images as it was too distracting and probably dated.</p>
<br>
<p>The simple box logos for the partner project seemed quite nice and minimal (the C in a box) but then I was either channelling the Photoshop icon or the periodic table maybe.</p>
<br>
<p>I like the yellowy colour I used on the Pproject and the way it changes to red on the mobile responsive site.</p>
